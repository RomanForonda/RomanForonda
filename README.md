# About me
🙋‍♂️Hi! My name is Román.

🎓I have a doctoral degree (PhD) in **Organic Chemistry** with a strong background in **medicinal chemistry**, **synthesis**, and **drug discovery**. Currently, I work as a **postdoctoral researcher** at the Technical University of Denmark, developing small molecules to degrade target RNA. 

💻After **+6 years** of international research experience working in the lab, I’m now embarking on an exciting new journey to expand my expertise into **cheminformatics**, **big data and data analysis**, **programming**, **molecular docking**, **computational chemistry**, and **artificial intelligence** — all applied to the chemical, biotech, and pharmaceutical sectors.Currently self-learning:
  -Python for scientific computing
  -RDKit and molecular descriptors
  -SQL and chemical data pipelines
  -Machine learning & molecular property prediction
  -Virtual screening & docking
  -Generative models for molecule design

🔬 My goal is to learn, become a better proffesional and bridge experimental chemistry with digital technologies to accelerate innovation in drug discovery and molecular design. I'm building projects that reflect this intersection — from small tools to full pipelines.

📚 **Open to collaboration, ideas, and feedback as I grow into this new field. Let’s connect and build the future of computational chemistry together!**
